# MLOps Project Specification

## Title
**MLOps Pipeline for Machine Learning Model Training and Deployment**

## Description

This project implements a complete MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline that demonstrates best practices for machine learning model development, training, evaluation, and artifact management. The project focuses on creating a reproducible and scalable machine learning workflow using synthetic data for classification tasks.

### Key Components

- **Training Pipeline**: Automated model training workflow with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- **Model Management**: Systematic saving and versioning of trained models, scalers, and performance metrics
- **Data Processing**: Synthetic data generation and preprocessing capabilities using scikit-learn
- **Artifact Storage**: Organized storage of model artifacts with timestamps for version control
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics collection and logging for model evaluation

### Technical Stack

- **Python 3.x** as the primary programming language
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Standard Library** modules for logging, serialization, and file management

### Current Implementation

The project currently includes:
- A Random Forest classifier training pipeline
- Synthetic data generation (1000 samples, 20 features)
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and classification reports
- Automated artifact saving with timestamps
- Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
